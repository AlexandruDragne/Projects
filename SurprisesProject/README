# This project is an app for creating, storing and distributing different types of surprises:
- Candy, FortuneCookie and MinionToy are the classes used to create the surprise objects.
- FIFOBag, LIFOBag and RandomBag are classes that define the container objects, with queue, stack and random behavior. They all implement the IBag interface, so they override the same methods. This also makes the app scalable, for the possibility of creating new bags at a later time.
- GatherSurprises is used to generate the candies (delegating this to the constructors).
- BagFactory is used to create any of the different types of containers.
- AbstractGiveSurprises, extended by 3 other classes (GiveSurpriseAnd...) is responsible of putting the generated surprises into bags and then distributing them, having the possibility of setting a waiting time between the releases.
- Test class comprises a comprehensive example of use of this app, by testing all of its features.
